Nitro Protocol
</h1>
This repository contains the smart contracts that define a state channel framework capable of running 3rd-party
'applications' that conform to a simple state-machine interface, and allow for large-scale state-channel networks. There is also a documentation website and helper functions written in TypeScript.

# ForceMove

The ForceMove framework takes a pragmatic approach to state channels directly funded by on-chain deposits: sacrificing generality of the supported applications,
for simplicity in the on-chain and off-chain logic. In particular, the framework can't (yet) support
any applications that have state transitions whose validity depends on time, or other properties
that are external to the channel's state. For example, as it currently stands, you couldn't build
a state channel sports betting game, where bets have to be made by a deadline and the winner
is determined through an oracle feed.

A full description of the framework and it's capabilities can be found in the [whitepaper](https://magmo.com/force-move-games.pdf).

# Nitro and the nitro-adjudicator

Nitro protocol subsumes and extends ForceMove by allowing for ledger channels (which can allocate funds to other state channels) and virtual channels (which allow intermediaries to help other state-channel-network users open and close channels off-chain).

A full description of the framework and it's capabilities can be found in a second [whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/219).

The nitro-adjudicator supports an arbitrary number of state channels, and introduces new on-chain functions to manage state channel networks.

### Development

We use [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) for smart contract development.

To get started:

1. Download the repo and `cd` into the directory.
2. Make a `.env` file from the `.env.example`, like this:

```
DEFAULT_GAS=6721975
DEFAULT_GAS_PRICE=20000000000
DEV_GANACHE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DEV_GANACHE_PORT=8545
ENABLE_SOLC_OPTIMIZER=TRUE
SOLC_VERSION=0.5.2
```

3. Run `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn test`.

## Documentation website

0. Run `yarn docgen` to auto-generate markdown files from Solidity source code (using [`solidity-docgen`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen))
1. Run `cd website`
1. Run `yarn install`
1. Run `yarn start`

See https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation for more information.

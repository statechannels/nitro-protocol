title: Introduction to Nitro
---

Nitro handles the funding of channels.
It describes how the funds are held on-chain for a channel, how to interpret the channel outcomes to determine the payouts and how to execute those payouts.

In Nitro a payout is of one of two types: it is either a payout to a channel participant or it is a payout to another channel.
It is this second type of payout that allows channels to fund one another in Nitro, enabling the virtual channels that are used to build state channel networks.
